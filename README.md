# Contributing
If you want to help and add a new feature, you can create a pull request to merge in the `develop` branch and not in the `master`.
As the name says, the `develop` branch is for developing where we'll add new features, with your help; instead we'll update the `master` every now and then, and from that we'll release a new jar.
