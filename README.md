# Contributing
If you want to help and add a new feature, you can create a pull request to merge in the `develop` branch and not in the `master`.
As the name says, the `develop` branch is for developing where we'll add new features, with your help; instead we'll update the `master` every now and then, and from that we'll release a new jar.

# Known issues

## I got `BUILD FAILED`
Most of the time it's because the you didn't execute step 2 of the README.

After that, just try `gradlew clean build`.

If there's still a problem, open an issue.

## The bot doesn't catch Pokemon

Currently not reproducible so can't be reliably fixed. Look here for some people that managed to get it fixed: https://github.com/jabbink/PokemonGoBot/issues/21

Some possible issues:

 * Make sure your system time is (semi-)correct (let it autosync with an online server)
 * Make sure the mobile app is not on (kill the process if need be)
 * Make sure the account you're botting on did do the initial tutorial (mainly catching a starter Pokemon)

## Immediately after starting I get a LoginFailedException

- Make sure the provided credentials in the `config.properties` file are correct.
- If you're using PTC, your credentials are correct and your password is longer than 15 characters, only enter the first 15 characters of your account and the login should work.
- If there is a token present, remove it and retry.

## After 1.5 hours I get a errors with Google login

Known issue with the Java API handling login for Google.

## I get a RemoteServerException or something about "502"

The Pokemon Go servers are offline/too busy. Check IsPokemonGoDownOrNot.com

## The GUI only loads the command line.

Separate the windows as they're conjoined together.

## Where did the GUI go?

The GUI is now hosted on http://pogo.abb.ink/map.html

This URL is also shown in the console when you launch the bot.

## The bot refuses to login to my Google account

Make sure you enter the full emailaddress (including `@`) in the `username=` property.

## Error: unable to access jarfile xxxxx

Make sure you are working in the directory where the JAR file is located

## CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long

Known Windows issue, build the bot from a directory close to rootdir eg. `C:\pogobot\`

## FileNotFoundException: config.properties (No such file or directory)

Make sure windows didn't add `.txt` to the filename.
